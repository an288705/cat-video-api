# cat-video-api

If you love cats, this API is for you. This open source API contains hours of cat videos, ready for you to pull from. The API is deployed on heroku, and you can find it on https://cat-video-api.herokuapp.com/cat_videos 
While I have uploaded all my favorite cat videos, there aren't enough to truly satisfy a cat lover's needs. I need help adding more cat videos, so feel free to contribute to my API and CATer to our fuzzy friends!
